# technical-test-fortis

Repo used for python technical test for Fortis AAI.

Before coding, make sure that the tests run correctly on your env.

----

The code shows the assignment implementations of Car and Bike.
The Bike class is just proof of concept because it introduces a comfortable_seat parameter just to be behaviourally different from Car.
Furthermore, it shows the testing of Car and Bike with both normal pytest code and property based testing.
